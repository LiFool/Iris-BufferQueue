Iris-BufferQueue
================

Iris-BufferQueue is a message queue implemented as a Java library. It is primarily intended for buffering data on local
host before processing it asynchronously.

Iris-BufferQueue has the following characteristics:

- It's an *in-process* queue, although writing to the queue and consuming from it can happen in two different processes
- It's *persisted* on disk, preserving data across application restarts and crashes
- *Publishing* to the queue can happen in parallel from *multiple threads*; *no synchronisation* is required
- *Consumption* from the queue can only be done by a *single thread*
- *Consumption* can be happen in *batches*

These characteristics are explained in greater detail in [the documentation](docs/characteristics.md).


Usage
-----

### Get the Jar

#### Maven

Add the following repository to the 'repositories' section of your pom.xml

    <repository>
      <id>clojars</id>
      <name>Clojars repository</name>
      <url>https://clojars.org/repo</url>
    </repository>

And add the following dependency to the 'dependencies' section of your pom.xml.

	<dependency>
	  <groupId>com.flipkart.iris</groupId>
	  <artifactId>bufferqueue</artifactId>
	  <version>0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>

#### Download

You can download the jar and find all the dependencies on [Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.flipkart.iris/bufferqueue).

### Create an instance

    File dir = new File("/tmp/bqtest");    // directory to create mapping files in
    int blockSize = 1024;                  // the mapped files are divided into "blocks", this is the size of each block
    long fileSize = 512 * 1024 * 1024;     // 512 MB
    int maxFiles = Integer.MAX_VALUE;      // maximum number of files to create, no impact as of now
    MappedDirBufferQueue bufferQueue = new MappedDirBufferQueue(dir, blockSize, fileSize, maxFiles);

### Publishing to the queue

    byte[] data = "Hello world!".getBytes();
    BufferQueue.Publisher publisher = bufferQueue.publisher();

##### High-level API

    if (publisher.publish(data)) {
        // success
    }
    else {
        // failure
    }

##### Low-level API

    BufferQueueEntry entry = publisher.claimFor(data).orNull();
    if (entry != null) {
    	try {
		    entry.set(data);
		}
		finally {
		    entry.markPublishedUnconsumed();
		}
	}
	else {
		System.out.println("Queue full, cannot write message");
	}

It is important that the `markPublishedUnconsumed()` call is done within a `finally` block to ensure that it is always made.

### Consuming from the queue

    BufferQueue.Consumer consumer = bufferQueue.consumer();

#### Unsafe APIs

When you use the unsafe APIs, you stand a chance to lose some data â€” if your code calls `consume` but dies before
processing the returned data, that data would have to be deemed lost i.e. it will not be available for processing again.

##### Unsafe Simple API

    byte[] data = consumer.consume().orNull());
    if (data != null) {
        // process data
	}
	else {
		// nothing to consume; maybe sleep for some time?
	}

##### Unsafe Batch API

	int batchSize = 100;
    List<byte[]> dataList = consumer.consume(batchSize);
    if (dataList.size() > 0) {
	    for (byte[] data : dataList) {
            // process data
	    }
	}
	else {
		// nothing to consumer; maybe sleep for some time?
	}	

#### Safe APIs

With safe APIs you'll have to explicitly confirm that you have processed any returned data; only after such a
confirmation will the data be discarded. But note: given that consumption from BufferQueue is sequential, if there is
even one particular entry whose processing is taking a long time, it'll stall all the consumption.

##### Safe Simple API

    BufferQueueEntry entry = consumer.peek().orNull());
    if (entry != null) {
	    try {
	        byte[] data = entry.get();
	        // process data
	    }
	    finally {
	        entry.markConsumed();
	    }
	}
	else {
		// nothing to consume; maybe sleep for some time?
	}

It is important that the `markConsumed()` call is done within a `finally` block to ensure that it is always made.

##### Safe Batch API

	int batchSize = 100;
    List<BufferQueueEntry> entries = consumer.peek(batchSize);
    if (entries.size() > 0) {
	    for (BufferQueueEntry entry : entries) {
	        try {
	            byte[] data = entry.get();
	            // process data
	        }
	        finally {
	            entry.markConsumed();
	        }
	    }
	}
	else {
		// nothing to consumer; maybe sleep for some time?
	}	

It is important that the `markConsumed()` call is done within a `finally` block to ensure that it is always made.
